# python-webapp-helm-template

A minimal Flask "Hello World" web app, containerized with Docker and deployed
to Kubernetes via a Helm chart and ArgoCD GitOps. This is the Helm-based
sibling of [python-webapp-template](https://github.com/rftecpro-ai/python-webapp-template),
which uses Kustomize instead.

Not shown above: `__pycache__/` and `.pytest_cache/` are ephemeral, gitignored
directories that Python/pytest regenerate locally — they're not part of the
repo. `.git/` is version-control internals.

See [CI/CD](#cicd) and [Deployment (ArgoCD / Kubernetes)](#deployment-argocd--kubernetes)
below for how these pieces fit together.

## Local development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

python app.py          # runs on http://localhost:8000
pytest                 # run tests
```

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t ffribeiro/python-webapp-helm-template:local .
docker run -p 8000:8000 ffribeiro/python-webapp-helm-template:local
```

## CI/CD

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push/PR to `main`:

- **test** — installs dependencies and runs `pytest`.
- **build-and-push** — on push to `main` only (after tests pass), builds a
  multi-arch (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) image and pushes it to Docker Hub
  as `ffribeiro/python-webapp-helm-template:<VERSION>` and `:<commit-sha>`.
- **update-manifest** — after the image is pushed, sets `image.tag` in
  [`chart/values-dev.yaml`](chart/values-dev.yaml) to `<commit-sha>` and
  commits that change back to `main` (with a skip-ci marker, so it doesn't
  re-trigger the pipeline). ArgoCD watches this same repo and syncs the `dev`
  environment automatically — every push to `main` results in that exact
  commit's image running in the cluster. There's no separate GitOps repo and
  no `prod` overlay yet; see [Deployment](#deployment-argocd--kubernetes)
  below for how a `prod` environment would be added.

### Releasing a new version

Every merge to `main` already ships a `:<commit-sha>` image to `dev` via the
pipeline above. Bumping `VERSION` is only needed when you want that build to
also carry a stable, human-meaningful Docker Hub tag (e.g. `1.1`) instead of
just the commit SHA.

1. Branch off `main` for the change, e.g. `release/1.1` (matching the version
   you're about to ship makes the intent obvious in the branch list, though
   the pipeline doesn't require this naming).
2. Make the code change and commit it.
3. Bump [`VERSION`](VERSION) to match (e.g. `1.0` → `1.1`). Without this, the
   `:<VERSION>` tag stays the same and just gets re-pushed pointing at the
   new commit — the `:<commit-sha>` tag still changes correctly.
4. Open a PR from `release/1.1` against `main` so `test` gates it before merge.
5. Merge to `main`. CI runs `test` → `build-and-push` → `update-manifest`,
   pushing the new image and bumping `chart/values-dev.yaml`'s tag.
6. ArgoCD picks up the change and syncs the `dev` `Application` automatically
   — no manual `kubectl apply` needed.
7. Verify the rollout in `dev` (`kubectl get pods`, confirm the image tag, hit
   the app, or check ArgoCD's sync status) before trusting the release.

`VERSION` and the code change are the only files you edit for a release.
[`chart/values.yaml`](chart/values.yaml)'s `image.tag` is just a chart
default and is never deployed as-is (`values-dev.yaml` always overrides it).
[`chart/values-dev.yaml`](chart/values-dev.yaml)'s `image.tag` is overwritten
automatically by `update-manifest` on every merge to `main`, using the commit
SHA — not the `VERSION` value. Any manual edit there gets clobbered on the
next merge anyway.

There's no `prod` environment in this repo today (see
[Deployment](#deployment-argocd--kubernetes) below) — if one is added as a
`values-prod.yaml` + ArgoCD `Application`, promoting to it should stay a
separate, deliberate step (e.g. a PR bumping `values-prod.yaml`'s tag to a
verified `dev` version), not something the pipeline does automatically.

### Required repository secrets

The push step needs these secrets set in the GitHub repo
(**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**):

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Your Docker Hub username |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | A Docker Hub [access token](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security) (not your password) |

I can't create these secrets for you (I don't have your Docker Hub credentials) —
add them manually before merging to `main`, otherwise the `build-and-push` job
will fail at the login step.

### Required repository permissions

`update-manifest` pushes a commit back to this repo using the default
`GITHUB_TOKEN`. If that push fails with a permissions error, enable
**Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → Read and write
permissions** for this repo.

## Deployment (ArgoCD / Kubernetes)

Kubernetes manifests are packaged as a Helm chart, with per-environment
values files — adding another environment later (e.g. `prod`) is just a new
`values-<env>.yaml`, no template duplication:

```
.
├── chart/
│   ├── Chart.yaml            # chart metadata
│   ├── values.yaml            # shared defaults
│   ├── values-dev.yaml        # dev-environment overrides (image tag)
│   └── templates/
│       ├── deployment.yaml    # Deployment (2 replicas, container port 8000)
│       └── service.yaml       # ClusterIP Service, port 80 → container port 8000
└── applications/
    └── argocd-app.yaml         # ArgoCD Application CRD, points at chart/ + values-dev.yaml
```

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`chart/templates/deployment.yaml`](chart/templates/deployment.yaml) | Deployment (2 replicas, container port 8000) |
| [`chart/templates/service.yaml`](chart/templates/service.yaml) | ClusterIP Service, port 80 → container port 8000 |
| [`chart/values.yaml`](chart/values.yaml) | Shared defaults for all environments |
| [`chart/values-dev.yaml`](chart/values-dev.yaml) | Sets the deployed image tag for `dev` |
| [`applications/argocd-app.yaml`](applications/argocd-app.yaml) | ArgoCD `Application` CRD, watches `chart/` with `values-dev.yaml` layered on top |

ArgoCD auto-detects the Helm chart from `Chart.yaml` at the watched path — the
`Application`'s `spec.source.helm.valueFiles` tells it which values file to
layer on top of the chart's defaults. Sync policy is automated with
`selfHeal: true` and `prune: true` — this repo is the source of truth. Manual
changes made directly against the cluster will be reverted, and resources
removed from the chart will be deleted from the cluster.

**One-time bootstrap** (run once against your cluster to register the app —
not something I can run for you, since it targets your local lab):

```bash
kubectl apply -f applications/argocd-app.yaml
```

After that, ArgoCD manages everything: CI's `update-manifest` job updates
`chart/values-dev.yaml`'s image tag on every push to `main`, ArgoCD detects
the drift, and syncs it to the cluster automatically.

**Infrastructure changes** (replicas, resource limits, ports): edit
[`chart/values.yaml`](chart/values.yaml) or the templates directly — these
are shared across all environments — and merge to `main`.
**Per-environment changes**: edit the relevant `values-<env>.yaml` instead.
Don't `kubectl apply` by hand either way, ArgoCD will just revert it.
